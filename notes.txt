The Deployment Process

The developer (you) writes some new code
The developer commits the code to Git
The developer pushes a new branch to GitHub
The developer opens a pull request to the main branch
A teammate reviews the PR and approves it (if it looks good)
The developer merges the pull request
Upon merging, an automated script, perhaps a Github action, is started
The script builds the code (if it's a compiled language)
The script builds a new docker image with the latest program
The script pushes the new image to Docker Hub
The server that runs the containers, perhaps a Kubernetes cluster, is told there is a new version
The k8s cluster pulls down the latest image
The k8s cluster shuts down old containers as it spins up new containers of the latest image
